/**
 * Downloads a track's audio to app-private storage (`filesDir/downloads`) for offline playback,
 * and tracks the outcome in Room via [DownloadedTrackDao] - that's the source of truth for
 * "is this downloaded" everywhere in the app (Library's Downloads tab, the Offline mode filter,
 * and [PlayerViewModel]'s decision to play from a local file instead of streaming). Per-byte
 * progress while a download is in flight is kept in memory only ([inProgress]); persisting that
 * to Room on every chunk would be pure churn for a number nothing needs after the download ends.
 *
 * A process-wide singleton (see [getInstance]) rather than a ViewModel-owned instance, since
 * downloads must keep running (and stay visible as "downloading") across whichever screen the
 * user navigates to next.
