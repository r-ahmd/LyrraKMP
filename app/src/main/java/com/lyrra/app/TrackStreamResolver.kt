/**
 * Resolves a catalog [Track] (title/artist only, no stream URL of its own) to a real, playable
 * stream by searching YouTube Music for it on demand and running the matched videoId through
 * [YouTubeStreamResolver]. [MusicData]'s tracks are just metadata - the actual CDN URL only
 * exists once we've looked the track up - so this runs lazily, right before playback needs it,
 * rather than up front for the whole catalog.
 *
 * Results are cached by track identity via a [ConcurrentHashMap] of in-flight/completed
 * [Deferred]s, so concurrent resolutions of the same track (e.g. rapid skip-back-and-forth)
 * dedupe onto a single network call instead of racing.
